download random screenshots from prnt.sc / prnt.sc image fuzzer (C#, console)

## How it works:
prnt.sc's URLs contain 6 characters (ASCII lowercase & numbers... e.g. https://prnt.sc/qwe123) <br>
So we can easily fuzz & download them <br>
If the downloaded image is the "The screenshot was removed" image it will be disposed rather then saved to the disk...<br>
<img src="preview.png" width="950" height="600">
